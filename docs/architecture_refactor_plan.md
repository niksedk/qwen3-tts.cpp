# Architecture Refactor Plan

Last updated: 2026-03-09

## Purpose

This document captures the current code-structure findings for the native `qwen3-tts.cpp` codebase and proposes a concrete refactor path to make the project easier to maintain without changing model behavior.

The immediate goal is not to redesign the runtime architecture. The goal is to:

- Split oversized source files into clearer modules
- Reduce implementation detail leakage in public headers
- Make ownership boundaries easier to understand
- Preserve current behavior, tests, and performance characteristics while refactoring

## Execution Status

Current branch status on `refactor/architecture-split`:

- Completed: internal transformer helper boundary introduced in `src/transformer/transformer_internal.h`
- Completed: debug trace implementation extracted into `src/transformer/transformer_debug.cpp`
- Completed: transformer model loading/config/tensor setup extracted into `src/transformer/transformer_loader.cpp`
- Confirmed after each completed step: local rebuild and test pass on the current Windows/CUDA workflow

Current transformer split status:

- Still in `src/tts_transformer.cpp`: KV-cache lifecycle, scheduler reservation, graph builders, runtime execution, sampling, and autoregressive generation
- Now moved out of `src/tts_transformer.cpp`: debug trace helpers, model load/unload path, GGUF config parsing, tensor creation, tensor data loading, CoreML loader hookup

Recommended next step from this point:

- Extract cache and scheduler lifecycle code into `src/transformer/transformer_cache.cpp`

Guardrail for ongoing work:

- Keep each extraction functionality-preserving and stop for rebuild/test after every mechanical step

## Current High-Level Architecture

The runtime is already organized around sensible pipeline stages:

1. `TextTokenizer`
2. `AudioTokenizerEncoder` (speaker encoder)
3. `TTSTransformer` (talker + code predictor)
4. `AudioTokenizerDecoder` (vocoder)
5. `Qwen3TTS` orchestration facade

At a coarse level, this is a good architecture. The main maintainability problems are not at the pipeline level; they are inside the implementation units.

## Current File Hotspots

Measured source file sizes in `src/`:

| File | Lines | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| `src/tts_transformer.cpp` | 3481 | Largest hotspot; mixes many unrelated concerns |
| `src/qwen3_tts.cpp` | 954 | Pipeline orchestration mixed with I/O and utilities |
| `src/audio_tokenizer_decoder.cpp` | 911 | Model loading, graph construction, layer helpers, runtime |
| `src/audio_tokenizer_encoder.cpp` | 712 | DSP frontend plus GGML runtime in one file |
| `src/tts_transformer.h` | 355 | Public header carries large amounts of private implementation detail |
| `src/audio_tokenizer_decoder.h` | 232 | Public header exposes internal model/state/layout structs |
| `src/qwen3_tts.h` | 173 | Public facade is reasonable, but utility functions and private details can still be separated better |

## Findings

### 1. `TTSTransformer` has too many responsibilities

`src/tts_transformer.cpp` currently owns all of the following:

- Debug trace configuration and binary dump helpers
- GGUF config parsing
- Tensor creation and tensor loading
- Backend and scheduler lifecycle
- Talker KV-cache management
- Code predictor KV-cache management
- Embedding lookup helpers
- Text projection
- Prefill embedding construction
- Talker graph construction
- Code predictor graph construction
- CoreML predictor setup and fallback path
- Forward execution helpers
- Sampling helpers
- Outer autoregressive generation loop

This is the single biggest refactor target.

### 2. The public transformer header is carrying implementation-only data

`src/tts_transformer.h` exposes:

- `tts_transformer_model`
- `tts_transformer_state`
- `tts_kv_cache`
- `transformer_layer`
- most private helper declarations

That makes the public header much heavier than it needs to be and couples downstream compilation to internal graph/model layout details.

### 3. `Qwen3TTS` mixes orchestration with unrelated utility code

`src/qwen3_tts.cpp` currently contains:

- GGML log filtering
- process memory snapshot helpers
- model path discovery and lazy-load policy
- synthesis orchestration
- WAV loading
- WAV saving
- resampling
- speaker embedding text/binary parsing
- speaker embedding serialization

These are separable concerns that do not need to live in a single translation unit.

### 4. Encoder frontend DSP and runtime graph code are coupled

`src/audio_tokenizer_encoder.cpp` currently mixes:

- mel filterbank generation
- DFT/window helpers
- mel spectrogram frontend
- GGUF loading
- graph construction
- graph execution

The DSP frontend should be split from model/runtime code.

### 5. Decoder layer definitions, graph assembly, and runtime are coupled

`src/audio_tokenizer_decoder.cpp` currently mixes:

- model loading
- codebook normalization
- graph cache management
- layer helper implementations (`Snake`, RMSNorm, residual/upsample/decoder blocks)
- full graph assembly
- runtime execution

The decoder has natural seams and should be split accordingly.

### 6. The current CMake target split is good enough

The existing top-level target structure is reasonable:

- `text_tokenizer`
- `tts_transformer`
- `audio_tokenizer_encoder`
- `audio_tokenizer_decoder`
- `qwen3_tts`

The refactor should not begin by changing target boundaries. The first step should be splitting source files inside the existing targets. That keeps build/test risk lower.

### 7. Oversplitting would also be a mistake

The right goal is not "tiny files". The right goal is coherent files with one main concern.

Practical target:

- Small helpers: under ~200 lines
- Normal implementation units: ~200-500 lines
- Complex graph/runtime units: ~400-700 lines

Files larger than ~800 lines should be exceptional and justified.

## Refactor Strategy

### Principle 1: Refactor by subsystem, not by class name alone

Each subsystem should be split by responsibility:

- model loading
- graph construction
- runtime execution
- utility/helpers
- optional debug/trace tooling

### Principle 2: Keep public APIs stable during Phase 1

Do not change the external `Qwen3TTS`, `TTSTransformer`, encoder, or decoder API surface in the first pass unless necessary for cleanup.

Phase 1 should be mostly movement and delegation.

### Principle 3: Move implementation detail out of public headers

Once the file split is stable, reduce header surface:

- move private structs into internal headers
- stop exposing model/state/block layout in public interfaces
- consider `pimpl` only after the split is complete

### Principle 4: Preserve history where practical

Large file splits can destroy useful `git blame` history if they are done as a single copy-paste rewrite.

Recommended approach:

- extract one subsystem slice at a time
- keep the first extraction mechanically simple
- prefer `git mv` when one file is the obvious primary successor
- accept normal Git copy detection for smaller helper files rather than forcing a noisy all-at-once duplication strategy

The goal is to preserve useful history without creating a temporary explosion of duplicated code.

### Principle 5: Lock a same-environment regression baseline before movement

Before Phase 1 begins, capture a deterministic baseline in the current environment.

Recommended baseline artifacts:

- existing `test_transformer` output expectations
- one fixed CLI smoke prompt under deterministic settings
- optional debug trace or speech-code dump for the same prompt
- optional same-machine hash of generated WAV and/or code output

Important constraint:

- bit-exact hashes are only a strong guard when backend, platform, and build configuration stay fixed

Use hashes as a local refactor guard, not as a portable cross-environment invariant.

## Proposed Directory Layout

Recommended source layout:

```text
src/
  common/
    audio_io.cpp
    audio_resample.cpp
    process_metrics.cpp
    speaker_embedding_io.cpp
  pipeline/
    pipeline_models.cpp
    pipeline_synthesize.cpp
    pipeline_runtime.cpp
  transformer/
    transformer_internal.h
    transformer_loader.cpp
    transformer_cache.cpp
    transformer_embeddings.cpp
    transformer_graph_talker.cpp
    transformer_graph_code_pred.cpp
    transformer_runtime.cpp
    transformer_generate.cpp
    transformer_debug.cpp
  encoder/
    encoder_internal.h
    encoder_loader.cpp
    encoder_frontend.cpp
    encoder_graph.cpp
    encoder_runtime.cpp
  decoder/
    decoder_internal.h
    decoder_loader.cpp
    decoder_layers.cpp
    decoder_graph.cpp
    decoder_runtime.cpp
```

The existing public headers may remain in `src/` initially to minimize churn.
Do not scaffold every file up front before code is moved. Create directories and implementation files incrementally as each extraction starts.

## Header Cleanup Plan

After the `.cpp` split is stable, reduce public header weight.

Recommended changes:

1. Keep public headers limited to:
   - public config/result types
   - public class declarations
   - public free-function declarations intended for consumers

2. Move implementation-only structs into internal headers:
   - `transformer_model_internal.h`
   - `transformer_graph_internal.h`
   - `transformer_debug_internal.h`
   - `encoder_internal.h`
   - `decoder_internal.h`

3. Remove large private helper declarations from public headers where possible by:
   - introducing internal helper classes or free functions in internal headers
   - using internal namespaces within each subsystem

Avoid replacing one oversized public header with one oversized internal header. Internal headers should also be split by concern when the subsystem is large enough to justify it.

4. Consider `pimpl` only after the split is complete.

`pimpl` is attractive for `TTSTransformer`, `AudioTokenizerEncoder`, and `AudioTokenizerDecoder`, but it is a Phase 2 or Phase 3 cleanup, not the first move.

## Recommended Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Split implementation files only

Scope:

- Introduce subsystem directories under `src/`
- Move logic into new `.cpp` files
- Keep existing class APIs stable
- Keep tests/build behavior unchanged

Exit criteria:

- Build and test commands remain the same
- No behavioral regressions
- `tts_transformer.cpp` reduced to a thin facade or removed entirely

### Phase 2: Move private structs and helpers into internal headers

Scope:

- create internal headers for transformer/encoder/decoder
- reduce public header surface
- remove implementation-only types from public headers where possible

Exit criteria:

- public headers are materially smaller
- implementation types no longer leak widely across the project

### Phase 3: Optional deeper encapsulation

Scope:

- evaluate `pimpl` for large runtime classes
- tighten translation-unit boundaries further

Exit criteria:

- public compile surface is stable and minimal
- internal ownership boundaries are clearer than today

## Refactor Order

Recommended order:

1. Transformer
2. Pipeline facade and common utilities
3. Decoder
4. Encoder

Why this order:

- `TTSTransformer` is the largest and highest-churn file
- `Qwen3TTS` becomes easier to clean once transformer responsibilities are clearer
- decoder and encoder splits are straightforward after the common pattern is established

## Guardrails

During refactor, preserve the following:

- public API names and behavior unless there is a deliberate API change
- exact prefill embedding behavior
- code predictor KV-cache semantics
- backend selection order
- deterministic/reference tests and regression scripts
- existing model-loading assumptions unless explicitly improved

Avoid combining refactor and optimization in the same changeset unless the optimization is trivial and mechanically obvious.

Refactor commits should also stay mechanically legible:

- separate file moves from behavioral edits where possible
- separate header-surface reduction from implementation relocation
- keep the first extraction in each subsystem intentionally conservative

## Validation Expectations

After each major split:

- build all existing targets
- run component tests where available
- run at least one CLI smoke test
- for transformer work, run `test_transformer`
- for pipeline changes, verify speaker embedding I/O and WAV save/load behavior

Before each major split:

- record the branch tip and target files being extracted
- capture the same-environment deterministic baseline used for comparison

## Immediate Next Refactor Task

Start with Phase 1 on `TTSTransformer`.

First concrete step:

1. Create `src/transformer/transformer_internal.h`
2. Capture a same-environment deterministic baseline for `test_transformer` and one CLI smoke prompt
3. Move debug trace helpers into `src/transformer/transformer_debug.cpp`
4. Move loader/config/tensor functions into `src/transformer/transformer_loader.cpp`
5. Update `CMakeLists.txt` to compile the new transformer source list with private include paths for internal headers
6. Rebuild and run transformer-focused tests before touching graph logic

This keeps the first refactor pass mostly mechanical and low-risk while immediately shrinking the largest file.
